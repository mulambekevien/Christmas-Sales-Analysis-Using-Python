# Insights and Recommendations
## Insights
These are some of the Insights i enerated from the analysis of the dataset:
- Most of the products sold were Toys
- The Gender Distribution of Customers is Approximately the same
- Most Males prefer having their gift Wrapped
- The distribution of methods of payment prefered is almost equal but most people prefer online payments
- Most sales occure during the Christmas Market, but are unaffected by Black Friday.

## Recommendations
Here are some of the Recommendations:
- Increase the number of toys in the shop being sold
- Have variety of products being sold cutting through all genders
- Have all the options of payment in business to avoid losing customers
- Remove black friday as a normal day hence dont give discounts
